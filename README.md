# Outdated!
Download the new mobile app from below. Remade in Flutter. Currently the codebase for the new mobile app is not public but will be soon.

# Notice!
Heya guys, thanks for your support. I had fun making this project, it was really good. But I think i'll be discontinuing the project soon, so i decided to open source the codebase of both mobile application and web application (sadly without getting to complete my personal milestone). I will still be looking for some bug fixes and stuffs but doubt will ever get time to implement new features. So feel free to make use of this project and any new features/bug-fix related PR are always welcome.
Link to the [source code](https://github.com/Dovakiin0/animeworldz) of the webapp.

will be writing development process here soon.
